## Notes from the Organizing Underground

> “The mandate of Los Angeles is that doing stuff takes movement, and in the distance between every two points on this city’s map there are a thousand books written in the raw space; in the process of movement here there’s no way not to be a witness. And witnessing this, here, is unlike being a witness anywhere else in the world.” — DH

We are two born-and-bred Angelenos, [@kpearson](https://github.com/kpearson) & [@machikoyasuda](https://github.com/machikoyasuda), committed to building the most open, most free (as in liberating), most people-and-maker-friendly meetup in Los Angeles - every other Wednesday, IRL. We want to share our stories here to help you do the same in your city.

Vamos a traducir en español y 日本語もがんばります！
